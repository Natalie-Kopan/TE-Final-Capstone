      Launched in 1984, <em>The Breakfast Book Club</em> became an inclusive
      book club amongst aspiring Tech Elevator classmates. While the concept of
      <em>The Breakfast Club</em> began as a study hall, it quickly grew into a
      fun-filled reading competition. The mantle has now been passed down to
      their kids where they can track daily reading, compete with friends and
      family to get prizes and continue the traditon of the club.
